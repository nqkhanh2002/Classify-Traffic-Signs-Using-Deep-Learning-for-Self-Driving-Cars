## About The Project
In this hands-on project, I will train deep learning models known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify 43 traffic sign images. This project could be practically applied to self-driving cars. In this hands-on project I will go through the following tasks: 
* (1) Import libraries and datasets 
* (2) Images visualization 
* (3) Convert images to gray-scale and perform normalization 
* (4) Build deep learning model 
* (5) Compile and train deep learning model 
* (6) Assess trained model performance
##  Dataset
I want to classify images of traffic signs using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- The dataset consists of 43 different classes of images. 
- Classes are as listed below: 
  - 0 = Speed limit (20km/h) 
  - 1 = Speed limit (30km/h)
  - 2 = Speed limit (50km/h) 
  - 3 = Speed limit (60km/h)
  - 4 = Speed limit (70km/h) 
  - 5 = Speed limit (80km/h)
  - 6 = End of speed limit (80km/h)
  - 7 = Speed limit (100km/h)
  - 8 = Speed limit (120km/h)
  - 9 = No passing
  - 10 = No passing for vehicles over 3.5 metric tons
  - 11 = Right-of-way at the next intersection
  - 12 = Priority road
  - 13 = Yield
  - 14 = Stop
  - 15 = No vehicles
  - 16 = Vehicles over 3.5 metric tons prohibited
  - 17 = No entry
  - 18 = General caution
  - 19 = Dangerous curve to the left
  - 20 = Dangerous curve to the right
  - 21 = Double curve
  - 22 = Bumpy road
  - 23 = Slippery road
  - 24 = Road narrows on the right
  - 25 = Road work
  - 26 = Traffic signals
  - 27 = Pedestrians
  - 28 = Children crossing 
  - 29 = Bicycles crossing
  - 30 = Beware of ice/snow
  - 31 = Wild animals crossing
  - 32 = End of all speed and passing limits
  - 33 = Turn right ahead
  - 34 = Turn left ahead
  - 35 = Ahead only
  - 36 = Go straight or right
  - 37 = Go straight or left
  - 38 = Keep right
  - 39 = Keep left
  - 40 = Roundabout mandatory
  - 41 = End of no passing
  - 42 = End of no passing by vehicles over 3.5 metric tons
